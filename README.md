# accessible-development-wiki
Welcome to the Accessibility Guide for our lab! This wiki serves as a practical reference to help us incorporate accessible design and development practices from the start of a project through to its completion. Instead of diving directly into the extensive Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we have distilled the essentials into actionable steps for each phase of a typical design and development process.
